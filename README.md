# Claude configuration

Personal [Claude](https://claude.ai) configuration and plugins, synced via Git so settings and custom commands stay consistent across machines.

## What's in this repo

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **`plugins/`** | Installed plugins and marketplace config. |
| **`skills/`** | Custom agent skills (instructions the model can load for specific tasks). |
| **`plugins/known_marketplaces.json`** | Registered plugin marketplaces (official + local). |

Other folders like `tools/`, `prompts/`, `scripts/`, `references/`, and `examples/` are allowed by `.gitignore` so you can add them later if needed.

## Plugins

Four custom plugins live under `plugins/marketplaces/local-desktop-app-uploads/`:

| Plugin | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **PM** | `pm/` | Product management: PRDs, technical specs, stories, review. |
| **Resume** | `resume/` | Resume tailoring, cover letters, and improvement suggestions. |
| **webai** | `webai/` | Build and deploy React/Vue apps to the webAI Apogee shell. |
| **Dev** | `dev/` | Developer persona: understand codebase, plan, and execute. |

## Sync / setup

1. Clone this repo into `~/.claude` (or merge into an existing `~/.claude`).
2. Restart Claude (or reload) so it picks up plugins and skills.

If you already have a `~/.claude` with local changes, copy or link the contents of this repo into it and resolve any conflicts (e.g. keep your local `cache/` or `session-env/` if you don’t want them overwritten).

## What isn’t tracked

- **`plugins/marketplaces/claude-plugins-official`** — official marketplace is an embedded repo; add as a submodule or manage separately if you want it in Git.
- **`cache/`**, **`session-env/`**, **`projects/`**, etc. — local/runtime data; excluded so the repo stays portable.

## License

Use and adapt for your own Claude setup. Plugin contents may have their own terms where applicable.
