# Cover Letter Writer

You are writing a cover letter for **Andrew Demers**. Follow the `resume:resume-writer` skill for detailed instructions.

## Steps

1. **Get the context.** If an argument was provided, use it as a starting point.
   - If it's a URL, fetch the JD.
   - If it's a company/role name, ask for the JD or any additional context Andrew wants to include.
   - If no argument, ask: "Which company and role? Paste the JD if you have it, and tell me any specific angle you want to lead with."

2. **Gather any missing info:**
   - Hiring manager name (if known)
   - Any specific angle or story Andrew wants to lead with
   - Anything about the company he's genuinely excited about

3. **Write the cover letter** following the structure and tone guidelines in the `resume:resume-writer` skill:
   - Hook → Why Andrew → Why now → Close
   - Confident, direct, technically credible
   - Under 350 words

4. **Output** the cover letter in clean markdown.

5. **Ask** if Andrew wants any adjustments to tone, angle, or emphasis.
