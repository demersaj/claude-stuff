# Resume Improvement

You are auditing and improving **Andrew Demers'** resume. Follow the `resume:resume-writer` skill for detailed instructions.

## Steps

1. **Determine scope.** If an argument was provided, focus on that section or feedback.
   - Examples: "improve my webAI bullets", "make the summary stronger", "full audit"
   - If no argument, do a full resume audit.

2. **Run the audit** per the improvement guidelines in the `resume:resume-writer` skill:
   - Achievement-oriented bullets (not just duties)
   - Quantified outcomes — find every bullet that can have a number added
   - Active, precise language
   - Career narrative clarity
   - Gaps, redundancies, weak spots

3. **Output specific rewrites.** For each improvement:
   - Show the **original** bullet
   - Show the **rewritten** version
   - One-line explanation of what changed and why

4. **Prioritize.** Lead with the highest-impact changes. Flag anything a hiring manager might question.

5. **Optionally offer** to produce a clean full resume with all improvements applied.
